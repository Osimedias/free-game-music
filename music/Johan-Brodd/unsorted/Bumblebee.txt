Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov wrote this piece back in 1899-1900 for the opera The tale of tsar Saltan, here is my roughened up and modernized version with a lot more pressure on poor Bumblebee. Drums comes from Heavyocity Damge, explosives from Native Instrument's Battery3 kit "Armageddon kit". Strings from Kontakt4's orchestra library.

Some info regarding rights. This song was written over 100 years ago, and Nikolai died in June 1908, so any musical rights should've been void in June 1978 when the track entered public domain. That's why I released this song here for anyone to use as they please.

Although the song is now public domain, I think it would still be honnorable if the end user would at least give credit to Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov for doing such a master piece,
