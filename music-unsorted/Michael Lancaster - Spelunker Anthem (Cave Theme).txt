I absolutely love caves, endless amounts of amazement and mystic wonder can be found in nearly every inch of one. Crystals and beautiful rock formations are just two of the amazing things about them. I composed this song with all these things in mind. If you close your eyes, you can explore as many caves as you want. =)
