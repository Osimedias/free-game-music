Hi !

Today, I've got 2 musics for you, and you're free to use/modify them as you want !


- "music_level_sokoban" is a loop used when the player needs to think a bit !

- "music_titlecard_sokoban" was made to be used as an opening when you see the title screen

They're both available in .wav, .ogg and .mp3 !

These two tracks were used in one of my games : Sulfur which is a remake of the famous "Sokoban", you can play it here (your pseudo is used to save your progression and for high scores :) )
