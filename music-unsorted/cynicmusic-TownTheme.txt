Town theme for an RPG. Typical harps and recorders fare perfect for your RPG.

This is for my upcoming game Pixelsphere (pixelsphere.org) also on Kickstarter until January 5, 2014. I'm sharing some of my assets (art, sound effects and music) with the community to thank you for all the great content you have contributed. Let me know which works you find useful and I will share more similar content.

Please contact me if you use my music, I'd really like to keep track of who's using it and give you a shoutout on my website!
