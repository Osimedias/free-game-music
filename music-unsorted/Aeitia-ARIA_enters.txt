About "Enter Gyokaijuu Mode!":

This is probably my own personal favourite song ever by me! ^^. Made it long ago, but didn't wan't to upload it because I used a particular type of synth bass that was ripped from a game. But I've changed it now to something more generic. The song is very simple, but I just think the melody is so catchy and enjoyable! Please enjoy!

 -The other 4 songs aren't as good, but they're from the same OST, and I thought I'd just upload them here rather than 5 seperate ones :)
